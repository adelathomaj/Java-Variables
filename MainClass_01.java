		 * 
		 * Imagine you have a cupboard with a lot of drawers.
		 * In each drawer you can put something.
		 * On each drawer you can put a label saying what is inside the drawer (sugar, salt etc.)
		 * and another label which gives a name to this drawer ("sugar cubes" , "sea salt" etc.)
		 * Such an imaginary "cupboard" is the RAM of the computer.
		 * Each drawer is a cell from the RAM of the computer
		 * 
		 * What are variables - a way to store information in the computer.
		 * Variables can be accessed by the name we give them ("sugar cubes" , "sea salt" etc.)
		 * 
		 * Variable type ==> lets call it label_01 on the drawer, saying what kind of "thing" do we keep inside (sugar, salt etc.)
		 * Variable name ==> lets call it label_02 on the drawer, saying what is the name of the "thing" which we keep inside "sugar cubes" , "sea salt" etc. )
		 * 
		 * To define a variable we must:
		 * 1.Specify the data type - set label_01 (sugar, salt etc.) 
		 * 2.Give the variable a name- set label_02  ("sugar cubes" , "sea salt" etc.)
		 * 
		 * Optionally we can add an expression to set a value for the variable, i.e. to put a real "something" in the drawer
		 * But the mandatory is only the labeling -setting lable_01 and label_02 
		 * 
		 * Let's see how this works

		/*
		 * At this stage you cannot print the variable, because it has not been initialized 
		 * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html
		Local variables are slightly different; the compiler never assigns a default value to an uninitialized local variable. 
		If you cannot initialize your local variable where it is declared, 
		make sure to assign it a value before you attempt to use it. 
		Accessing an uninitialized local variable will result in a compile-time error.

		/*
		 * What are the rules for naming variables:
		 * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/variables.html
		 * Please read the information about variable names
		 * Here are some:
		 * 1.Allowed symbols to start the name of a variable: a letter, an underscore, dollar-sign
		 * 2.The name can contain digits, but the first symbol cannot be digit
		 * 3.No keyword can be used as a variable name
		 * 4.Variable names are case-sensitive - var_01 is a different name than VAR_01
		 * 5.No spaces, no special characters
		 * 6.Use camelCase if the name of the variable is made of more than one word.
